# Weather_App
A weather app created using vanilla JavaScript and two different web APIs WeatherAPI.com and Geodb-cities-api.
It has a search bar function where you can search for a specific city to view its weather conditions and also information such as the weather during the day starting from the current time and the weather forecast for the next 3 days.
